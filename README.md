We, Anu-Ujin Gerelt-Od (ago265), Emmy Phung (mtp363), Elizabeth Combs (eac721), and Wendy Hou (wh916), form a team “NYC Foodies”. We hope to utilize the Yelp dataset to aggregate information on restaurants in NYC and build a success-formula for a restaurant based on its cuisine type. Traditionally, we think about recommender systems as targeting products to certain users. Our team would like to explore it from another perspective: recommending features for businesses to help them make themselves more appealing to customers. This study could help restaurants improve their Yelp profile, and in turn, their business. 


Our supervised learning will be 1) ranking restaurants in a specific area based on their cuisine-type and success and 2) then identifying the features contributing to their success. We will select a target variable that represents the success of a restaurant, such as overall rating or number of positive reviews in a specific time period. From these positive instances, we will identify the features that correlate with the restaurant’s success indicators. Our feature variables include qualitative information that we extract from reviews, the restaurant’s location data and image data from Yelp. We also consider using NYC restaurant health code ratings and demographics by neighborhood as additional features. Our baseline models to tackle the two problems stated above would be decision tree and logistic regression.
